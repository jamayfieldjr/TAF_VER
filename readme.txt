Present Weather: Each of the following weather types is verified separately in two 2-category contingency tables of forecasts versus observations and guidance versus observations. The two categories comprising each of these contingency tables are occurrence and non-occurrence of the weather type. Precipitation intensity is not verified.

(1) Liquid precipitation—rain (RA), rain showers (SHRA), drizzle (DZ),
(2) Snow types—snow (SN), snow showers (SHSN), snow grains (SG),
(3) Freezing precipitation—freezing rain (FZRA), freezing drizzle (FZDZ),
(4) Ice types, i.e., ice crystals (IC), ice pellets (PL), showers of ice pellets
(SHPL), small (less than 1/4 inch diameter) hail/snow pellets (GS),
showers of GS (SHGS),
(5) Thunderstorms (TS), including funnel clouds (FC) and
tornadoes/waterspout (+FC). Some observation stations do not report
thunderstorms. These METARs use the TSNO remark. Thunderstorms in
the TAF may not be verified under these conditions.
(6) Hail (1/4 inch or greater diameter) (GR) and showers of GR (SHGR),
(7) Fog/Mist—Fog (FG), mist (BR), and freezing fog (FZFG),
(8) Haze (HZ) and smoke (FU),
(9) All dust and sand events, i.e., widespread dust (DU), blowing dust
(BLDU), drifting dust (DRDU), dust storm (DS), sand/dust whirls (PO),
blowing sand (BLSA), drifting sand (DRSA), and sandstorm (SS).
(10) Blowing spray (BLPY),
(11) Blowing snow (BLSN), drifting snow (DRSN),
(12) Volcanic ash (VA), and
(13) Squalls (SQ). 


6.2.3 TAF Verification Reports. NWS employees access verification statistics through the
Stats on Demand feature of the NWS Verification Web Page. Stats on Demand accesses an
interactive database and generates verification statistics customized to the user’s request. The
user is able to request data for any TAF element, a single forecast type (e.g. prevailing, TEMPO)
and, if desired, corresponding data from a single guidance product (i.e., MOS, LAMP,
persistence) for one or more:
 a. months,
 b. scheduled TAF beginning times, i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC,
 c. projection period groups (see section 6.2.4),
d. verification sites (single site, multiple sites, WFO forecast area, NWS Region, or
national). When a single WFO forecast area or a subset of it is selected, a
forecaster may use his/her private password to request verification statistics from
Stats on Demand that include only the forecasts made by that forecaster. The
personalized password will protect the privacy of each forecaster and keep
individualized verification statistics confidential.
The user of Stats on Demand also specifies one of the following options concerning scheduled
and amended TAFs: (a) verify scheduled TAFs only, (b) verify amended TAFs only, or (c) verify
scheduled and amended TAFs.
Most verification statistics are computed from categorical contingency tables of forecasts versus
observations for TAFs and the user-selected guidance product. Since forecasts are evaluated
every 5 minutes, the contingency tables usually contain twelve entries per hour per verification
site. Forecast categories for each element are defined in section 6.2.5.
6.2.4 Projections. Scheduled TAFs are issued and verified for projections of 24 hours beyond
the initial valid time of the most recent scheduled TAF. For verification purposes, projections
are defined from the initial valid time of the TAF, which is 0000, 0600, 1200, or 1800 UTC for
scheduled TAFs and the issuance time for amendments. When the user requests verification
statistics for scheduled TAFs only, he/she selects one or more of the following projection period
groupings:
 a. greater than zero to 3 hours, 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
38
 b. greater than 3 to 6 hours,
 c. greater than 6 to 9 hours,
 d. greater than 9 to 12 hours,
 e. greater than 12 to 24 hours.
When the user requests verification statistics for amended TAFs only or scheduled and amended
TAFs combined, he/she selects one or both of the following projection periods:
 a. greater than zero to 3 hours,
 b. greater than 3 to 6 hours.
6.2.5 Elements. The user of Stats on Demand specifies a single element. To receive results for
multiple elements, the user must run Stats on Demand separately for each element desired.
a. Ceiling Height. Ceiling height is recorded in the database in hundreds of feet
AGL and verified in the following categories. From these categories, contingency
tables of forecasts versus observations and guidance versus observations are
prepared, and verification statistics are computed. Sometimes categories are
combined.
 1: Less than 200 feet,
2: 200 to 400 feet,
3: 500 to 900 feet,
4: 1000 to 1900 feet,
5: 2000 to 3000 feet,
6: Greater than 3000 feet (includes cases with no ceiling).
A 2-category verification is also available whenever the user selects a critical
threshold value, x (in hundreds of feet), which is defined by the user.
 1: Ceiling less than x,
2: Ceiling greater than or equal to x (includes cases with no ceiling).
b. Visibility. Visibility is recorded in the database in statute miles and fractions
thereof and verified in the following categories. From these categories,
contingency tables of forecasts versus observations and guidance versus
observations are prepared, and verification statistics are computed. Sometimes
categories are combined.
1: Less than ½ statute mile, 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
39
 2: ½ to less than 1 statute mile,
3: 1 through less than 2 statute miles,
4: 2 through less than 3 statute miles,
5: 3 through 5 statute miles,
6: Greater than 5 statute miles.
 A 2-category verification is also available whenever the user selects a critical
threshold value, y (in statute miles), which is defined by the user.
 1: Visibility less than y,
 2: Visibility greater than or equal to y.
c. Flight Category. To determine the flight category, the ceiling and visibility are
each converted to the categories in Table 16. The categories for ceiling and
visibility are then combined by taking the lower category of the two. This is the
flight category. From these categories, contingency tables of forecasts versus
observations and guidance versus observations are prepared, and verification
statistics are computed. Sometimes categories are combined.
 A 2-category verification is also available whenever the user selects the following
critical threshold values: x (in hundreds of feet) for ceiling and y (in statute miles)
for visibility, which are defined by the user.
 1: Ceiling less than x or visibility less than y.
 2: Ceiling greater than or equal to x and visibility greater than or equal to y.
Table 16. Categories for ceiling and visibility used to determine the flight category.
CATEGORY CEILING (feet) VISIBILITY (statute miles)
Very Low Instrument Flight Rules
(VLIFR)
less than 200 less than ½
Low Instrument Flight Rules (LIFR) 200 to 400 ½ to less than 1
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) 500 to 900 1 to less than 3
Marginal Visual Flight Rules (MVFR) 1000 to 3000 3 to 5
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) no ceiling or
greater than 3000
greater than 5
d. Wind Direction. From the following categories, contingency tables of forecasts
versus observations and guidance versus observations are prepared, and
verification statistics are computed. Wind direction is not verified whenever (1)
the observed speed is less than 6 knots or (2) the observed or forecast direction is
unspecified due to calm or variable winds.
 1: North (340 to 20 degrees), 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
40
 2: Northeast (30 to 60 degrees),
 3: East (70 to 110 degrees),
 4: Southeast (120 to 150 degrees),
 5: South (160 to 200 degrees),
 6: Southwest (210 to 240 degrees),
 7: West (250 to 290 degrees),
 8: Northwest (300 to 330 degrees).
e. Sustained Wind Speed. From these categories, contingency tables of forecasts
versus observations and guidance versus observations are prepared, and
verification statistics are computed.
 1: Less than 8 knots,
 2: 8 to 12 knots,
 3: 13 to 17 knots,
 4: 18 to 22 knots,
 5: 23 to 27 knots,
 6: 28 to 32 knots,
 7: greater than 32 knots.
f. Wind Gusts. From these categories, contingency tables of forecasts versus
observations are prepared, and verification statistics are computed. MOS
guidance is not available for wind gusts.

 2: 16 to 22 knots,
 3: 23 to 27 knots,
 4: 28 to 32 knots,
