The overall TAF cig
percentage correct is
the total number of
points for correct
forecasts (pcf) divided
by the total number of

multiplied by 100
((pcf/ap)*100).

Verify within forecast

The overall TAF vis
percentage correct is
the total number of

by the total number of

multiplied by 100
((pcf/ap)*100).
Wind Speed + or – 9 knots Verify all forecast groups
where wind speeds are GTE
than 6 knots. If the forecast is
within 9 knots it is a correct
forecast. For 10 knots or
greater of error the forecast is
incorrect.
The hourly score is
one point for a correct
forecast and zero
points for an incorrect
forecast.
The overall TAF
Wind Speed
percentage correct is
the total number of

by the total number of

multiplied by 100
((pcf/ap)*100).
Wind
Direction
+ or – 50/30
degrees
Verify all forecast groups.
For periods when winds are
more than 6 knots but less
than 15 knots, if the forecast
direction is within 50 degrees,
the forecast is correct. For
periods when winds are
greater than, or equal to, 15
knots, if the forecast direction
is within 30 degrees the
forecast is correct. When the
forecast error is greater than
these thresholds, the forecast
is incorrect.
The hourly score is
one point for a correct
forecast and zero
points for an incorrect
forecast.
The overall TAF
Wind Direction
percentage correct is
the total number of
points for correct
forecasts (pcf) divided
by the total number of
available points (ap)
multiplied by 100
((pcf/ap)*100).
Wind Gusts + or – 10 knots of
observed gusts
If gusts occur and are within
10 knots of the forecast
criteria or no gusts are
forecast and no gusts occur, it
is counted as a correct
forecast. For all cases where
gusts are not forecast and
gusts occur, no points are
awarded.
The hourly score is
one point for a correct
forecast and zero
points for an incorrect
forecast.
The overall TAF
Wind Gust percentage
correct is the total
number of points for
correct forecasts (pcf)
divided by the total
number of available

Verify all forecast groups
using the Critical Success
Index (CSI), which is correct
forecast / (correct forecast +
incorrect forecasts). Total
score ranges from 1 to 0.
An incorrect forecast is when
a phenomena is forecast but
not observed or not forecast
The hourly score is
the hourly CSI, with a

Lowest
Altimeter
Setting
Measured for every
forecast group
(except TEMPO).
Verify within forecast
categories as a correct
forecast or an incorrect
forecast as follows: If the
lowest altimeter observed
during a given hour was no
more than .05 inches (ins) Hg
lower than forecast during
that hour it counts as a correct
forecast. If the lowest
altimeter observed during a
given hour was more than .05
ins Hg lower than forecast
during that hour it counts as
an incorrect forecast.
The hourly score is
one point for a correct
forecast and zero
points for an incorrect
forecast.
The overall TAF
