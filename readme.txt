Weather Support Plan 


Criteria Evaluate Requirement Hourly Score and Overall Percentage Correct 

Ceiling (cig) 
i.   All specification and amendment criteria as Weather support plan 
ii.  Verify within forecast categories as a correct forecast or an incorrect forecast for all groups.
iii. The hourly score is one point for a correct forecast and zero points for an incorrect forecast.
iv.  The overall TAF cig percentage correct is the total number of points for correct forecasts (pcf) divided by the total number of
     available points (ap) multiplied by 100 ((pcf/ap)*100).

Visibility (vis) 
i.   All specification and amendment criteria as documented on the Weather support
ii.  Verify within forecast categories as a correct forecast or an incorrect forecast for all groups.
iii. The hourly score is one point for a correct forecast and zero points for an incorrect forecast.
iv.  The overall TAF vis percentage correct is the total number of points for correct forecasts (pcf) divided by the total number of
     available points (ap) multiplied by 100 ((pcf/ap)*100).
     
Wind Speed 
i.   + or – 9 knots 
ii.  Verify all forecast groups where wind speeds are GTE than 6 knots. If the forecast is within 9 knots it is a correct
     forecast. For 10 knots or greater of error the forecast is incorrect.
iii. The hourly score is one point for a correct forecast and zero points for an incorrect forecast.
iv.  The overall TAF Wind Speed percentage correct is the total number of points for correct forecasts (pcf) divided by the total number      of available points (ap) multiplied by 100 ((pcf/ap)*100).

Wind Direction
i.   + or – 50/30 degrees Verify all forecast groups.
ii.  For periods when winds are more than 6 knots but less than 15 knots, if the forecast direction is within 50 degrees,
     the forecast is correct. For periods when winds are greater than, or equal to, 15 knots, if the forecast direction
     is within 30 degrees the forecast is correct. When the forecast error is greater than these thresholds, the forecast
     is incorrect.
iii. The hourly score is one point for a correct forecast and zero points for an incorrect forecast.
iv.  The overall TAF Wind Direction percentage correct is the total number of points for correct forecasts (pcf) divided by the total        number of available points (ap) multiplied by 100 ((pcf/ap)*100).

Wind Gusts 
i.   + or – 10 knots of observed gusts
ii.  If gusts occur and are within 10 knots of the forecast criteria or no gusts are forecast and no gusts occur, it is counted as a          correct forecast. For all cases where gusts are not forecast and gusts occur, no points are awarded.
iii. The hourly score is one point for a correct forecast and zero points for an incorrect forecast.
iv.  The overall TAF Wind Gust percentage correct is the total number of points for correct forecasts (pcf) divided by the total
     number of available points (ap) multiplied by 100 ((pcf/ap)*100).
     
Present Weather
i.  Each phenomena separately, precipitation in liquid, freezing, or frozen, obscurations, and other. Intensity/proximity qualifiers are not mandatory for verification. 
ii. Verify all forecast groups using the Critical Success Index (CSI), which is correct forecast / (correct forecast + incorrect forecasts). Total score ranges from 1 to 0.
iii. An incorrect forecast is when a phenomena is forecast but not observed or not forecastverification. but was observed. 
iv. The hourly score is the hourly CSI, with a perfect forecast = to 1 point, and less than a perfect forecast a fraction of a point as
defined by the CSI formula.
v.  The overall TAF present weather score is the sum of the number of points (and fractions of a point) awarded each hour
    each for correct forecasts (pcf) divided by the total number of available points (ap) multiplied by 100 ((pcf/ap)*100).
    
Lowest Altimeter Setting
i. No used 

Combined TAF Accuracy
i.  The overall TAF score using all available points earned divided by the possible available points for every hour in the
    TAF for all groups that were forecast, TEMPO and FM.
ii. Compute the sum of the total points correctly forecast (pcf) per group and divide by the sum of the total available points (ap) per group.
iii. (TEMPO pcf + FM pcf) / (BECMG ap + TEMPO ap + FM ap)

Compute TAFVER MOPs
according to Table 4.1 for the
model produced TAF (if
applicable). Subtract the model
produced TAF MOPs from the
FITL TAF MOPs to determine the
