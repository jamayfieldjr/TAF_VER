Present Weather: Each of the following weather types is verified separately in two 2-category contingency tables of forecasts versus observations and guidance versus observations. The two categories comprising each of these contingency tables are occurrence and non-occurrence of the weather type. Precipitation intensity is not verified.

(1) Liquid precipitation—rain (RA), rain showers (SHRA), drizzle (DZ),
(2) Snow types—snow (SN), snow showers (SHSN), snow grains (SG),
(3) Freezing precipitation—freezing rain (FZRA), freezing drizzle (FZDZ),
(4) Ice types, i.e., ice crystals (IC), ice pellets (PL), showers of ice pellets
(SHPL), small (less than 1/4 inch diameter) hail/snow pellets (GS),
showers of GS (SHGS),
(5) Thunderstorms (TS), including funnel clouds (FC) and
tornadoes/waterspout (+FC). Some observation stations do not report
thunderstorms. These METARs use the TSNO remark. Thunderstorms in
the TAF may not be verified under these conditions.
(6) Hail (1/4 inch or greater diameter) (GR) and showers of GR (SHGR),
(7) Fog/Mist—Fog (FG), mist (BR), and freezing fog (FZFG),
(8) Haze (HZ) and smoke (FU),
(9) All dust and sand events, i.e., widespread dust (DU), blowing dust
(BLDU), drifting dust (DRDU), dust storm (DS), sand/dust whirls (PO),
blowing sand (BLSA), drifting sand (DRSA), and sandstorm (SS).
(10) Blowing spray (BLPY),
(11) Blowing snow (BLSN), drifting snow (DRSN),
(12) Volcanic ash (VA), and
(13) Squalls (SQ). 


6.2.3 TAF Verification Reports. NWS employees access verification statistics through the
Stats on Demand feature of the NWS Verification Web Page. Stats on Demand accesses an
interactive database and generates verification statistics customized to the user’s request. The
user is able to request data for any TAF element, a single forecast type (e.g. prevailing, TEMPO)
and, if desired, corresponding data from a single guidance product (i.e., MOS, LAMP,
persistence) for one or more:
 a. months,
 b. scheduled TAF beginning times, i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC,
 c. projection period groups (see section 6.2.4),
d. verification sites (single site, multiple sites, WFO forecast area, NWS Region, or
national). When a single WFO forecast area or a subset of it is selected, a
forecaster may use his/her private password to request verification statistics from
Stats on Demand that include only the forecasts made by that forecaster. The
personalized password will protect the privacy of each forecaster and keep
individualized verification statistics confidential.
The user of Stats on Demand also specifies one of the following options concerning scheduled
and amended TAFs: (a) verify scheduled TAFs only, (b) verify amended TAFs only, or (c) verify
scheduled and amended TAFs.
Most verification statistics are computed from categorical contingency tables of forecasts versus
observations for TAFs and the user-selected guidance product. Since forecasts are evaluated
every 5 minutes, the contingency tables usually contain twelve entries per hour per verification
site. Forecast categories for each element are defined in section 6.2.5.
6.2.4 Projections. Scheduled TAFs are issued and verified for projections of 24 hours beyond
the initial valid time of the most recent scheduled TAF. For verification purposes, projections
are defined from the initial valid time of the TAF, which is 0000, 0600, 1200, or 1800 UTC for
scheduled TAFs and the issuance time for amendments. When the user requests verification
statistics for scheduled TAFs only, he/she selects one or more of the following projection period
groupings:
 a. greater than zero to 3 hours, 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
38
 b. greater than 3 to 6 hours,
 c. greater than 6 to 9 hours,
 d. greater than 9 to 12 hours,
 e. greater than 12 to 24 hours.
When the user requests verification statistics for amended TAFs only or scheduled and amended
TAFs combined, he/she selects one or both of the following projection periods:
 a. greater than zero to 3 hours,
 b. greater than 3 to 6 hours.
6.2.5 Elements. The user of Stats on Demand specifies a single element. To receive results for
multiple elements, the user must run Stats on Demand separately for each element desired.
a. Ceiling Height. Ceiling height is recorded in the database in hundreds of feet
AGL and verified in the following categories. From these categories, contingency
tables of forecasts versus observations and guidance versus observations are
prepared, and verification statistics are computed. Sometimes categories are
combined.
 1: Less than 200 feet,
2: 200 to 400 feet,
3: 500 to 900 feet,
4: 1000 to 1900 feet,
5: 2000 to 3000 feet,
6: Greater than 3000 feet (includes cases with no ceiling).
A 2-category verification is also available whenever the user selects a critical
threshold value, x (in hundreds of feet), which is defined by the user.
 1: Ceiling less than x,
2: Ceiling greater than or equal to x (includes cases with no ceiling).
b. Visibility. Visibility is recorded in the database in statute miles and fractions
thereof and verified in the following categories. From these categories,
contingency tables of forecasts versus observations and guidance versus
observations are prepared, and verification statistics are computed. Sometimes
categories are combined.
1: Less than ½ statute mile, 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
39
 2: ½ to less than 1 statute mile,
3: 1 through less than 2 statute miles,
4: 2 through less than 3 statute miles,
5: 3 through 5 statute miles,
6: Greater than 5 statute miles.
 A 2-category verification is also available whenever the user selects a critical
threshold value, y (in statute miles), which is defined by the user.
 1: Visibility less than y,
 2: Visibility greater than or equal to y.
c. Flight Category. To determine the flight category, the ceiling and visibility are
each converted to the categories in Table 16. The categories for ceiling and
visibility are then combined by taking the lower category of the two. This is the
flight category. From these categories, contingency tables of forecasts versus
observations and guidance versus observations are prepared, and verification
statistics are computed. Sometimes categories are combined.
 A 2-category verification is also available whenever the user selects the following
critical threshold values: x (in hundreds of feet) for ceiling and y (in statute miles)
for visibility, which are defined by the user.
 1: Ceiling less than x or visibility less than y.
 2: Ceiling greater than or equal to x and visibility greater than or equal to y.
Table 16. Categories for ceiling and visibility used to determine the flight category.
CATEGORY CEILING (feet) VISIBILITY (statute miles)
Very Low Instrument Flight Rules
(VLIFR)
less than 200 less than ½
Low Instrument Flight Rules (LIFR) 200 to 400 ½ to less than 1
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) 500 to 900 1 to less than 3
Marginal Visual Flight Rules (MVFR) 1000 to 3000 3 to 5
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) no ceiling or
greater than 3000
greater than 5
d. Wind Direction. From the following categories, contingency tables of forecasts
versus observations and guidance versus observations are prepared, and
verification statistics are computed. Wind direction is not verified whenever (1)
the observed speed is less than 6 knots or (2) the observed or forecast direction is
unspecified due to calm or variable winds.
 1: North (340 to 20 degrees), 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
40
 2: Northeast (30 to 60 degrees),
 3: East (70 to 110 degrees),
 4: Southeast (120 to 150 degrees),
 5: South (160 to 200 degrees),
 6: Southwest (210 to 240 degrees),
 7: West (250 to 290 degrees),
 8: Northwest (300 to 330 degrees).
e. Sustained Wind Speed. From these categories, contingency tables of forecasts
versus observations and guidance versus observations are prepared, and
verification statistics are computed.
 1: Less than 8 knots,
 2: 8 to 12 knots,
 3: 13 to 17 knots,
 4: 18 to 22 knots,
 5: 23 to 27 knots,
 6: 28 to 32 knots,
 7: greater than 32 knots.
f. Wind Gusts. From these categories, contingency tables of forecasts versus
observations are prepared, and verification statistics are computed. MOS
guidance is not available for wind gusts.
 1: No gusts or gusts less than 16 knots,
 2: 16 to 22 knots,
 3: 23 to 27 knots,
 4: 28 to 32 knots,
 5: 33 to 37 knots,
 6: 38 to 42 knots,
 7: 43 to 47 knots,
 8: greater than 47 knots. 

6.2.6 Forecast Types. TAFs primarily predict prevailing conditions and use the “from” (FM)
change indicator to introduce changes to the forecast prevailing conditions. Prevailing forecast
verification is described in paragraph a. Another “type” of forecast, called the operational
impact forecast, is defined in paragraph b. Sometimes a TEMPO or PROB change indicator is
used to respectively designate a temporarily fluctuating or probabilistic forecast condition.
When a TEMPO or PROB change indicator is used, two forecasts are valid for the same time.
TEMPO and PROB forecast evaluation is explained, respectively, in paragraphs c and d. The
following terms will be repeated several times in paragraphs a through d and are defined: 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
42
 (1) Change. For ceiling and visibility, change is defined as category change.
Categories for these elements are defined in section 6.2.5. Each of the
thirteen weather types is a binary variable, and change is defined as the
starting or stopping of that weather type. Precipitation intensities are
ignored. For wind direction, change is defined (a) as a 40-degree or
greater wind shift between successive observations, considering only 6-
knot or greater observations or (b) by a variable wind remark. For
sustained wind speed, change is defined as at least an 8-knot increase or
decrease between successive observations. For wind gusts, change is
defined as (a) at least a 10-knot increase or decrease between successive
observations or (b) when successive observations change from the
existence of gusts to no gusts or vice versa.
 (2) Hit. For ceiling and visibility, a forecast hit is defined as the forecast
category equaling the observation category, and categories are defined in
section 6.2.5. For each of the thirteen weather types, a hit occurs when the
forecast and observation agree on the occurrence or non-occurrence of that
weather type. For sustained wind speed, a hit occurs whenever the
absolute error is less than 8 knots. For wind gusts, a hit occurs whenever
the absolute error is less than 10 knots or neither observation nor forecast
contains gusts. Forecast and observed gusts less than 16 knots are treated
as no gusts.
 (3) Less [More] in Error. When comparing two forecast types (i.e., prevailing
and TEMPO, prevailing and PROB) for ceiling or visibility, less [more] in
error means the TEMPO or PROB forecast was not a hit and had a smaller
[larger] absolute categorical error than the prevailing forecast (use the
categories defined for ceiling and visibility in section 6.2.5) . For wind
direction, sustained wind speed and wind gusts, less [more] in error means
the TEMPO or PROB forecast was not a hit, and the absolute error of the
TEMPO or PROB forecast was lower [higher] than the absolute error of
the prevailing forecast. All thirteen weather types are binary variables, so
the term “less [more] in error” is not used when referring to any of them.
 (4) More [Less] Favorable Flight Conditions. When comparing two forecasts
types (i.e., prevailing and TEMPO, prevailing and PROB) for ceiling or
visibility, the more [less] favorable flight conditions are defined as the
higher [lower] category forecast, using the categories defined for each
element in section 6.2.5. For each of the thirteen weather type forecasts
(each is a binary variable), the more [less] favorable flight conditions are
defined as the negative [positive] forecast of the event. For sustained
wind speed and wind gust forecasts, the more [less] favorable flight
conditions are defined as the lower [higher] speed forecast. “No gust”
forecasts are 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
43
 more favorable than gust forecasts and vice versa. Wind direction
forecasts are not compared in this manner.
 a. Prevailing Forecast. The prevailing forecast is defined as (1) the forecast
conditions that are in the initial time period of the TAF and (2) any forecast
conditions that immediately follow a FM change indicator. For the element
specified by the user of Stats on Demand (e.g., ceiling), the prevailing forecast is
evaluated at the end of every 5-minute interval of the TAF by comparing it to the
most recent METAR/SPECI available. Most verification is categorical, using the
categories defined in section 6.2.5, and results are recorded twelve times per hour
in contingency tables of forecasts versus observations. Prevailing forecasts may
be evaluated by themselves, or they may be matched with one guidance product at
a time, producing an additional contingency table of guidance forecasts versus
observations. Conventional verification statistics are computed from the
contingency tables, and comparisons may be drawn between prevailing forecast
and guidance performance.
 b. Operational Impact (OIF). TAFs are sometimes formatted in a manner whereby
two forecasts are valid for a single terminal at the same time. One of the
following circumstances applies to all NWS TAFs at all times: (1) Just the
prevailing forecast is in effect. (2) The prevailing forecast is in effect
simultaneously with a forecast for temporary conditions (TEMPO). (3) The
prevailing forecast is in effect simultaneously with a 30% or 40% probabilistic
forecast (PROB). For verification, the OIF is defined as the forecast in effect that
is most likely to have the largest impact on operations. The following rules are
used to determine the OIF:
 (1) The OIF is undefined for wind direction.
 (2) If no TEMPO or PROB forecast is in effect for the user-specified element,
then the OIF for that element is defined as the prevailing forecast.
 (3) If a PROB forecast is in effect for the user-specified element, then the OIF
for that element is defined as the forecast (prevailing or PROB) of the less
favorable flight conditions, i.e., lower ceiling category, lower visibility
category, higher wind speed, or the occurrence of the weather type.
 (4) If a TEMPO forecast is in effect for the user-specified element, then the
OIF for that element is defined through a two step process.
 (a) First step—the variability test. The legitimacy of the TEMPO
forecast is first evaluated by a variability test at the end of every 5-
minute interval of the TAF. If the observation database changed
twice or more ±90 minutes from the end-point of the 5-minute 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
44
interval, then the TEMPO forecast passes the variability test for
that 5-minute interval. Note: This test just measures condition
variability—it does not measure forecast correctness.
 (b) Second step. If the TEMPO forecast fails the variability test for a
given 5-minute interval, then the OIF for that interval is defined as
the forecast with the less favorable flight conditions, i.e., lower
ceiling category, lower visibility category, higher wind speed, or
the occurrence of the weather type.
 If the TEMPO forecast passes the variability test for a given 5-
minute interval, then the OIF for that interval is defined as (1) the
forecast with the smallest categorical error for ceiling and
visibility; (2) the smallest error for wind speed and wind gusts; or
(3) no error for weather type.
 (5) The OIF for flight category is determined by first calculating the OIF
separately for ceiling and visibility. Then, the OIFs for ceiling and
visibility are each converted to the categories in Table 16. The lower
category of the two is the flight category OIF.
 Just like the prevailing forecast, the OIF is evaluated only for the element
specified by the user of Stats on Demand at the end of every 5-minute interval
that the TAF is valid. At each of these times, the OIF is compared to the most
recent METAR/SPECI available. Most verification is categorical, using the
categories defined in section 6.2.5, and results are recorded twelve times per hour
in contingency tables of forecasts versus observations. OIFs may be evaluated by
themselves, or they may be matched with one guidance product at a time,
producing an additional contingency table of guidance forecasts versus
observations. Conventional verification statistics are computed from the
contingency tables, and comparisons may be drawn between OIF performance
and guidance performance.
 c. TEMPO Forecast. The TEMPO forecast is evaluated at the end of every 5-minute
interval that the TEMPO forecast is valid for the user-specified element. TEMPO
forecast evaluation is separate from OIF evaluation, but some of the same
methodology is employed for TEMPO evaluation as OIF evaluation. Since no
guidance product provides TEMPO forecasts, TEMPO forecast verification
statistics are not matched with guidance. The following statistics are tallied:
 (1) Number of hours. This is the total number of hours (the number of 5-
minute intervals divided by 12) that TEMPO groups were valid for the
user-specified element. Data are given to the nearest hour. 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
45
 (2) Justified TEMPO (%). This is the percentage of 5-minute intervals within
the TEMPO groups that passed the aforementioned OIF variability test for
the user-specified element and is re-stated: For each 5-minute interval
inside a TEMPO group, if the observation database changed twice or more
±90 minutes of the end-point of that 5-minute interval, then the TEMPO
forecast for that 5-minute interval is justified. This statistic just measures
condition variability—it does not measure forecast correctness. Example:
A TEMPO group is in effect from 0800 until 1200 UTC. The end of every
5-minute interval must be checked for justification. Start with the end time
of 0800-0805 UTC and see if two or more changes occur between 0635
and 0935 UTC (0805 UTC ±90 minutes). If a 1500-foot ceiling at 0635
UTC rises to 2500 feet at 0720 UTC, and then drops to 1200 feet at 0840
UTC, then two changes occurred between 0635 and 0935 UTC, making
the TEMPO group justified for the 0800-0805 UTC interval. Repeat this
process for every five minute interval until you finish the TEMPO group at
noon (last 5-minute interval is 1155-1200 UTC). Assuming no more
ceiling category changes occurred after 0840 UTC, the % time that the
0800-1200 UTC TEMPO group was justified was 10/48 = 21%. After
0850 UTC, none of the 5-minute intervals were “justified”(no changes or
only one change occurred ±90 minutes of the end time of each 5-minute
interval). Hence the justification test passed between 0800 and 0850 UTC
and failed after 0850 UTC, making the numerator 10. The denominator is
48 (12 possible changes per hour times 4 hours).
 (3) Justified TEMPO–Hit (%). Considering only the 5-minute intervals when
the TEMPO forecast was justified for the user-specified element, this is
the percentage of time that the TEMPO forecast was a hit. Ideally, this
statistic ranges between 10 and 49. Example: Between 0600 and 0820
UTC, the observations indicated that ceilings varied sufficiently to justify
a TEMPO group. The TAF prevailing group forecast ceilings at 800 feet,
the TEMPO group forecast ceilings at 300 feet, and ceilings 200 to 400
feet, inclusive, were observed at the end of 40% of the 5-minute intervals
between 0600 and 0820 UTC. TEMPO Hit (%): 40.
 (4) Justified TEMPO–Improved the TAF (%). Considering only the 5-minute
intervals when the TEMPO forecast was justified, this is the percentage of
time that the TEMPO forecast was not a hit; however the TEMPO forecast
was less in error than the prevailing forecast. Since each of the thirteen
weather types are binary variables and can only hit or miss, they are not
evaluated with this statistic. Ideally, 10 to 49 percent of these TEMPO
cases are hits (previous statistic), and this statistic is zero. Example:
Between 0600 and 0820 UTC, the observations indicated that ceilings
varied enough to justify a TEMPO group. The TAF prevailing group
forecast ceilings at 1200 feet, the TEMPO group forecast ceilings at 700 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005
46
feet, and ceilings between 200 and 400 feet were observed at the end of
40% of the 5-minute intervals between 0600 and 0820 UTC. TEMPO
improved TAF (%): 40.
 (5) TEMPO Should Be FM (%). Considering only the 5-minute intervals
when the TEMPO forecast was not justified, this statistic is the percentage
of time when the TEMPO forecast was a hit, resulting in an incorrect
prevailing forecast. Ideally, this statistic is zero. Example: During the
period that the observations indicated that ceilings did not vary enough to
justify a TEMPO group, the TAF prevailing group forecast ceilings at
1200 feet, the TEMPO group forecast ceilings at 800 feet, and ceilings
were observed between 500 and 900 feet all the time. TEMPO S/B FM
(%): 100.
 (6) TEMPO Benign (%). Considering only the 5-minute intervals when the
TEMPO forecast was not justified, this statistic is the percentage of time
whenever (a) the TEMPO forecast was more in error than the prevailing
forecast, and (b) the TEMPO forecast predicted more favorable flight
conditions than the prevailing forecast. In these cases, poor TEMPO
forecasts are benign to flight operations because the pilot has already
planned for the less favorable flight conditions in the prevailing forecast.
Wind direction is not evaluated with this statistic. Ideally, this statistic is
zero. Example: The TAF prevailing group forecast ceilings at 700 feet,
the TEMPO group forecast ceilings at 1200 feet, and ceilings were
observed between 500 and 900 feet at the end of 90% of the 5-minute
intervals that failed the justification test. Tempo Benign (%): 90.
 (7) TEMPO Hurt (%). Considering only the 5-minute intervals when the
TEMPO forecast was not justified, this statistic is the percentage of time
whenever (a) the TEMPO forecast was more in error than the prevailing
forecast, and (b) the TEMPO forecast predicted less favorable flight
conditions than the prevailing forecast. In these cases, poor TEMPO
forecasts hurt flight operations because the pilot is forced to plan for the
less favorable flight conditions that ultimately do not occur. Wind
direction is not evaluated with this statistic. Ideally, this statistic is zero.
Example: The TAF prevailing group forecast ceilings at 1400 feet, the
TEMPO group forecast ceilings at 600 feet, and ceilings were observed
between 1000 and 1900 feet at the end of 90% of the 5-minute intervals
that failed the justification test. TEMPO Hurt (%): 90.
 d. PROB Forecast. The PROB forecast is evaluated at the end of every 5-minute
interval that the PROB forecast is valid for the user-specified element. Since no
guidance product provides PROB forecasts, PROB forecast verification statistics
are not matched with guidance. The following statistics are tallied: 
 NWSI 10-1601 NOVEMBER 3, 2005

 (1) Number of Hours: This is the total number of hours (the number of 5-
minute intervals divided by twelve) that PROB groups were valid for the
user-specified element. Data are given to the nearest hour.
 (2) PROB Hit (Element + precip/TS) (%): This is the percentage of all 5-
minute intervals within PROB groups for the user-specified element that
(a) were forecast hits and (b) precipitation or a thunderstorm occurred.
Credit is not granted if the user-specified element is a hit, but precipitation
or a thunderstorm did not occur. All elements are eligible for evaluation
except precipitation and thunderstorms. Ideally, this statistic is between
30 and 40. Example: The prevailing forecast is 4000 feet, the PROB
forecast is 1500 feet, and light rain is forecast with the lower ceilings.
Ceilings between 1000 and 1900 feet with light snow were observed at the
end of 30% of the 5-minute intervals. Prob Hit w/ precip/TS: 30. Note:
The 30% hit rate occurred even though rain was forecast with the lower
ceilings and snow was observed. For this statistic, any type of
precipitation or a thunderstorm is sufficient to verify the ceiling. The
significant weather type (incorrect rain forecast) is verified separately in
the significant WX type rows. If no precipitation had occurred with the
lower ceilings, the forecaster would not have gotten credit for the ceilings
and the Prob Hit w/ precip/TS would have been zero.
(3) PROB Hit w/out precip/TS (%): This is the percentage of 5-minute
intervals that the user-specified element forecast in PROB groups was a
hit, even though precipitation or a thunderstorm type (TS, FC, +FC)
defined in previous bullet) did not occur. All elements are verified except
for the following significant weather types: all precipitation types (rain
types, snow types, ice types, freezing precipitation, hail) and thunderstorm
types (TS, FC, +FC). For all precipitation types and thunderstorm types,
this column is “blacked out.” Example: The prevailing ceiling forecast is
4000 feet, the PROB forecast is 1500 feet, and light rain is forecast with
the lower ceilings. Ceilings between 1000 and 1900 feet were observed at
the end of 30% of the 5-minute intervals, but no precipitation or
thunderstorm events occurred at the end of these 5-minute intervals. Prob
Hit w/out precip/TS: 30.
 (4) PROB Hit (Precip/TS only) (%): This is the percentage of 5-minute
intervals within PROB groups that were forecast hits. Only precipitation
and thunderstorms are eligible for evaluation. Ideally, this statistic is
between 30 and 40.
 (5) PROB Improved the TAF (%): This is the percentage of 5-minute
intervals within PROB groups for the user-specified element whenever the

PROB forecast was not a hit, but the PROB forecast was less in error than
the prevailing forecast. Unlike “PROB Hit,” credit is granted whenever
precipitation or a thunderstorm does not occur with the user-specified
element. All elements are eligible for evaluation except the thirteen
weather types. Ideally, this statistic is zero. Example: The TAF prevailing
group forecast ceilings at 1200 feet, the PROB group forecast ceilings at
700 feet, ceilings below 200 to 400 feet were observed 40% of the time,
and ceilings 1000 feet or higher were observed 60% of the time. Prob Imp
(%): 40.
 (6) PROB Benign (%). This is the percentage of all 5-minute intervals within
PROB groups for the specified user-element whenever (a) the PROB
forecast was more in error than the prevailing forecast, and (b) the PROB
forecast predicted more favorable flight conditions than the prevailing
forecast. In these cases, the poor PROB forecasts are benign to flight
operations, because the pilot has already planned for the less favorable
flight conditions in the prevailing forecast. Wind direction is not eligible
for evaluation. Ideally, this statistic is zero. Example: The TAF prevailing
group forecast ceilings at 700 feet, the PROB group forecast ceilings at
1200 feet, and ceilings were observed between 500 and 900 feet at the end
of 90% of the 5-minute intervals. Prob Benign (%): 90.
 (7) PROB Hurt (%). This is the percentage of all 5-minute intervals within
PROB groups for the user-specified element whenever (a) the PROB
forecast was more in error than the prevailing forecast, and (b) the PROB
forecast predicted less favorable flight conditions than the prevailing
forecast. In these cases, the poor PROB forecasts hurt flight operations,
because the pilot is forced to plan for the less favorable flight conditions
that ultimately do not occur. No check is made to see if precipitation or
thunderstorms occurred with the other elements and weather types. Wind
direction is not evaluated with this statistic. Ideally, this statistic is zero.
Example: The TAF prevailing group forecast ceilings at 1400 feet, the
PROB group forecast ceilings at 600 feet, and ceilings were observed
between 1000 and 1900 feet 90% of the time. Prob Hurt (%): 90.
