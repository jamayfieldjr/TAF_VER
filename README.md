To verify Terminal Aerodrome Forecast based upon point scheme.  

Point Scheme

Flight Rules	Contraction	Ceiling	Visibility
Very low instrument flight rules	VLIFR ceiling	< 200 feet	visibility < 0.5 mile
low instrument flight rules	LIFR	> 200 feet and < 500 feet	> 0.5 mile and < 1 mile
instrument flight rules	IFR	> 500 and < 1000 feet	> 1 and < 3 miles
marginal visual flight rules	MVFR	> 1000 and < 3000 feet	> 3 and <5 miles
visual flight rules	VFR	> 3000 feet	> 5 miles
