Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Verification 


Objective:

To verify Terminal Aerodrome Forecast based upon point scheme based upon safety of aviation.  

Point Scheme

Amendment within 6 hours (1 Point)
Amendment based upon a change a weather not a correction 

Visibility (5 Points)

Info: Visibility Based upon NWS WSOM Chapter D-31 

5 points - Visibility is greater than 5 statute miles
4 points - Visibility is equal or greater than 3 statute miles and equal or less than 5 statute miles
3 points - Visibility is equal or greater than 1 statute mile and less than 3 statute miles
2 points - Visibility is equal or greater than 1/2 statute mile and equal or less than 1 statute mile
1 point - Visibility is less than 1/2 statute mile

Ceiling (5 Points) 

Info: Ceiling Based upon NWS WSOM Chapter D-31 

5 points - Ceiling is greater than 3000 feet
4 points - Ceiling is equal or greater than 1000 feet and equal or less than 3000 feet
3 points - Ceiling is equal or greater than 500 feet and less than 1000 feet
2 points - Ceiling is equal or greater than 200 feet and equal or less than 500 feet
1 point - Ceiling is less than 200 feet 

Present Weather (1 Point)

Info: Thunderstorms producing hail either are hazardous conditions which can destory or damage equipment/aircraft at the ramp. Freezing Rain, Rain mix with Ice Pellets, Heavy Snow, and other weather conditions can affected takeoff, landing, and ramp operations at an aerodrome. 

1 Point SHRA/RA/TSRA/TSSH/VCTS/TSRAGR/TSRAGS/SN/FZRA/RAPL/PLRA 

Visibility Obscrution (1 point)

Info: Depending on 2 meter temperature record by the ASOS Fog or Freezing Fog can be a condition which creates harzardous conditions on the ramp and the aircraft would need to be deiced at the ramp for takeoff operations. 

1 Point (FG/FZFG) 

Tempoary Group or Intermittant Group 

Speical consideration of a TEMPO or INTER group is taken either a conditions exists or doesn't and occurs less than half of the time.  

Significant variation
Aerodrome forecasts will include significant changes or variations (indicated by FM, BECMG, INTER and TEMPO) to the previously given conditions when the relevant criteria are met. These relate to improvements as well as deteriorations.

The variation groups TEMPO and INTER are used to indicate significant variations of a temporary or intermittent nature. The change groups FM and BECMG are used to specify changes that are more lasting in nature. The indicators are the beginning of a self-contained forecast.

When thunderstorms or reduced visibility due to fog, mist, dust, smoke or sand is forecast, but the probability is assessed at between 30 per cent and 40 per cent, the terms PROB30 or PROB40 are used. INTER or TEMPO may also be used with a PROB for thunderstorms. If greater than, or equal to, 50 per cent probability is forecast, reference is made to the phenomenon in the forecast itself and not by the addition of a PROB statement.
