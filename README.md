# TAF_VER
Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Verification


TAFclouds.py - obtains the cloud layer and cloud height units (ft AGL)

TAFtime.py - obtains the time of the begin and end of each from, temporary, probability, and becoming (UTC)

TAFweather.py - obtains the weather (i.e.) +/- (modifiers), VC, RA SN FZRA ... etc. 

TAFwind.py - obtains the weather (i.e.) +/- (modifiers), VC, RA SN FZRA ... etc. 

TAFwindshear.py - obtains altitude, wind speed, and wind direction 

TAFverticalvisibility.py - obtains verticial visibility units (ft AGL)

In development * 
1. main.py to run the program as a Python 3 module 
2. updating the programs with functions and classes 
3. TAFverstats.py - obtains statsitics of the TAF verificaed by routine Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report (METARs)
